SYMBIOTIC ECOSYSTEMS.
Lichen are fungi which have mastered agriculture. 
They use photosynthetic algae to produce carbohydrates. In return, the fungi provide shelter to the algae by protecting it from the enviroment.

Plants and fungi communicate and network with one another though the use of their roots and mycelium. They pass chemical signals back and forth, exchanging important information about the world around them. It's a bit like how we send memes to one another.

This is an excellent example of a symbiotic relationship. In a relationship like this, both parties help one another to survive. They mutually beneficial from this agreement between fungi and algae which has existed since time immemorial.
