Happy Birthday!

It's been a long time, and I hope you're enjoying life on your own.
Last weekend, your cousin and I took a trip to the fjords
and we saw actual icebergs on their way down the coast!
If I can offer you some unsolicited advice, see as much of the universe as you can,
because 9th life gets closer with every passing day.

Here's your present.
It's my "feline navigation system" from when I was a kitten.

Keep exploring,
Aunt Tabby.

P.S.
Greetings from your Uncle, he's got into the catnip again and is scratching our new sofa.
