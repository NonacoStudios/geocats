CULTICATION & HORTICULTURE.
Do you have a passion for collecting rare things? Cultivating unique lichens could be your dream hobby!

At the Lichen Conservatory, Dr. Letharia and her coworkers mass produce rare lichens in an effort to combat poaching and general enviromental destruction. 

Biodiversity in the desert valley is at a record high. One survey of this ecosystem found an average of 60 different species of Lichen per square metre.
