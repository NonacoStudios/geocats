WILDLIFE.
If you plan to hike in the wilderness, remember you are a visitor in someone elses back yard. 

The Great Litterbox is home to many species of life. The one that causes the most trouble to hikers is Solitudinem Eucestoda, or the Desert Tapeworm. These giant sandworms are more scared of you than you are of them. Travel in tight groups, and always bring a can of Worm spray.

Protip: Walk without rhythm, and you won't attract the worm.
