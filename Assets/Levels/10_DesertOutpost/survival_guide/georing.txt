The Georing.
This is the artificial structure orbiting around a solar body that we call home. 
It's unknown when or why it was created, and seems to be made of carbon nanotubes.

The edges of the Georing extrude many kilometres into the sky. 
This seems to keep the breathable atmosphere from excaping into space.
The dark side of the Georing is inhospitable to most life, but some extremophile organisms have found a niche there.
The Georing's slow spinning rotation allows for it's inhabitants a day and night cycle.
