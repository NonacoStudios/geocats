MEWLANGE.
This rare type of catnip has many incredible powers. It's known to heighten the sense of awareness, lengthen lifespans, and generally improve health. Some reports even claim it lets one see into the future.

This plant is only known to grow in the deserts of the Great Litterbox and horticulturalists have not been successful at cultivating this variety in other enviroments. It has an aromatic smell, and never tastes the same way twice.
