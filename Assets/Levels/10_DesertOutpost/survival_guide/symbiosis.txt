Symbiotic Relationships.

Lichen are fungi which have mastered agriculture. 
They use photosynthetic algae to produce carbohydrates.
In return, the fungi provide shelter to the algae by protecting it from the enviroment.

This is an excellent example of a symbiotic relationship. 
In a relationship like this both parties help one another to survive.
This mutually beneficial agreement between fungi and algae has existed since time immemorial.
