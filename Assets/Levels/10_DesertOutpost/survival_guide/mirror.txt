MIRRORS.
The edges of the Georing are lined with mirrors, which are tilted at varying degrees.  This design is an ancient artificial mechanism that reflects sunlight into the ring.

The Lichen Conservatory is considered a unique biozone, due to it's lack of sunlight from these mirrors. This creates a comparatively cool and temperate area in an otherwise inhospitable zone. Giant desert lichens thrive in this perpetually pleasant, and relatively moist enviroment.
