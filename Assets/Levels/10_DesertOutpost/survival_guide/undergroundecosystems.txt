Underground ecosystems.

The underground is often teeming with as much life as the surface is.
This unseen biospere is rich in complexity, and scientist are still only... Scratching the surface. 

Plants and fungi communicate and network with one another though the use of their roots and mycelium.
They pass chemical signals back and forth, exchanging important information.
Bugs, bacteria, and small animals also make their home in the underground.
The underground is cooler than the surface and provides shelter to those who call it home.
