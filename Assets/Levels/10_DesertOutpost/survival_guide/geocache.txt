Geocaching.

This activity is technically forbidden in the Great Litterbox, 
but that doesn't stop intrepid explorers from roving the dunes in search of treasure.

The shifting sands of the Litterbox are unforgiving. 
Bring a metal detector and plenty of water if you plan to embark on an adventure here.
We also recommend investing in a solar charger for keeping emergency devices operable in a pinch.
(Nonaco is currently sold out of solar chargers.)
