The Great Litterbox is dry and hot. 
Navigating it's expanses is terribly difficult, as landmarks are far and few between. 
The sand and rocks absorb the suns heat. The hot wind wicks moisture from unsuspecting travellers.

It's reccomended that travellers shelter by day and travel by night.
If stranded, try to keep a layer between yourself and the sand.
The secret to surviving the desert? Keep a cool head and a dry sense of humour.
